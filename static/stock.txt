Problem Statement:
Create a Java program that simulates a stock price tracker using a static variable to keep track
of the total number of stocks being tracked.
Requirements:
1. Create a Class:
o Name the class Stock.
2. Define the following attributes and methods inside the Stock class:
o A static variable named totalStocks to track the total number of stocks being
tracked.
o An instance variable tickerSymbol to store the stock's ticker symbol.
o An instance variable currentPrice to store the stock's current price.
o A constructor to initialize the stock's ticker symbol and price when a stock is
created. The totalStocks variable should increment each time a stock is created.
o A static method getTotalStocks that returns the total number of stocks being
tracked.
o A method updatePrice to update the current price of the stock.
o A method displayStockInfo to print the stock's details (tickerSymbol and
currentPrice).
3. In the Main Class:
o Create multiple instances of the Stock class representing different stocks.
o Update stock prices using the updatePrice method.
o Display details of all the stocks using the displayStockInfo method.
o Display the total number of stocks being tracked using the getTotalStocks
method.
Acceptance Criteria:
• The static variable totalStocks should accurately reflect the total number of stocks
created.
• Stock prices should be updated and displayed correctly.
• The Main class should demonstrate the functionality clearly.
