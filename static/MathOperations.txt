Problem Statement:
Create a Java program that illustrates the use of a `static` method for performing a basic
mathematical operation.
Requirements:
1. Create a class named "MathOperations."
2. Inside the "MathOperations" class, define a `static` method named "add" that takes two integers
as parameters and returns their sum.
3. In the "Main" class, use the "add" method to perform addition operations on two sets of numbers
and display the results.
Sample Output:
```
Adding 5 and 7: 12
Adding 10 and 20: 30
```
Ensure that your Java program effectively demonstrates the use of a `static` method for performing
addition and displaying the results.
