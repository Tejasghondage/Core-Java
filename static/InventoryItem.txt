Problem Statement:
Create a Java program that simulates a basic inventory system for a store using a `static` variable to
keep track of the total number of items in stock.
Requirements:
1. Create a class named "InventoryItem."
2. Inside the "InventoryItem" class, define the following attributes and methods:
 - A `static` variable named "totalItems" to keep track of the total number of items in stock.
 - An instance variable named "itemName" to store the name of the item.
 - An instance variable named "quantity" to store the quantity of the item in stock.
 - A constructor that initializes the item's name and quantity when an object is created.
 - A `static` method named "getTotalItems" that returns the total number of items in stock.
 - A method named "addToInventory" that takes an integer as a parameter and adds it to the item's
quantity while also incrementing the "totalItems" variable.
 - A method named "removeFromInventory" that takes an integer as a parameter and subtracts it
from the item's quantity while also decrementing the "totalItems" variable.
3. In the "Main" class, create instances of the "InventoryItem" class and perform the following
operations:
 - Create multiple inventory items.
 - Add items to the inventory and update the total items in stock.
 - Remove items from the inventory and update the total items in stock.
 - Display the total number of items in stock using the `getTotalItems` method.
Ensure that your Java program effectively demonstrates the use of the `static` variable to keep track
of the total number of items in stock and allows for adding and removing items from the
inventory.ults.
