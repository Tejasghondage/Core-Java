Problem Statement: Create a Java project for a Library Management
Create a Java class called LibraryBook to represent a book in a library. The LibraryBook class should
have the following attributes:
1. title (string) - The title of the book.
2. author (string) - The author of the book.
3. isbn (string) - The International Standard Book Number (ISBN) of the book.
4. available (boolean) - A flag indicating whether the book is available for borrowing.
Implement a parameterized constructor for the LibraryBook class that takes the title, author,
and ISBN as parameters and initializes these attributes. The available attribute should be set to true
by default when a book is created.
Additionally, create a method called borrowBook that allows a user to borrow the book. This
method should set the available attribute to false when the book is borrowed.
Create another method called returnBook that allows a user to return the book. This method
should set the available attribute back to true when the book is returned.
In your main method, create Object of the LibraryBook class to represent different books in
the library. Demonstrate the use of constructors, the borrowBook, and returnBook methods by
simulating book borrowing and returning scenarios.

Your task is to complete the LibraryBook class by implementing the constructor, borrowBook,
and returnBook methods as described. Then, create instances of the LibraryBook class in the
main method and demonstrate the use of these methods to simulate book borrowing and
returning.
