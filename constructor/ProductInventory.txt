Assignment Title: "Creating a Product Inventory Class with Constructors"
Problem Description:
You are tasked with creating a Java class to represent products in an
inventory system. The class should have constructors to initialize product
objects with basic information. You'll then create instances of this class and
demonstrate how to use constructors effectively.
Requirements:
Create a Java class named Product with the following attributes:
productId (int): An integer to store the product's ID.
productName (String): A string to store the name of the product.
price (double): A double to store the price of the product.
quantityInStock (int): An integer to store the quantity of the product in stock.
Implement a parameterized constructor in the Product class that takes
arguments to initialize the attributes mentioned above.
Implement a default constructor in the Product class that initializes the
attributes with default values (e.g., productId = 0, productName = "", price =
0.0, quantityInStock = 0).
Create at least two objects of the Product class using both the default
constructor and the parameterized constructor.
Demonstrate how to update the quantity of products in stock and print the
product information (attributes) after each update.
